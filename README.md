# plutoplot - Plutocode Plotting library

This is a Python 3 library for plotting output data from the [PLUTO code](http://plutocode.ph.unito.it/)

This library is under development and mostly specialized on the functionality I personally need. Nonetheless I will try to make the code as widely applicable and documented as possible.

There is no completed documentation yet, but most functions/classes should have a docstring.
